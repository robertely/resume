## Twilio/SendGrid
### Staff Observability Engineer
##### Jul 2016 — Current
On the Observability team, I've driven initiatives to increase the reliability and performance of our monitoring systems. I've planned and deployed a complete refactor of our VM monitoring stack. I designed and implemented our Kubernetes monitoring stack from scratch while dramatically lowering our operational toil through well-tested automation. Before moving to the Observability team, I worked on the Developer Tools team working to improve Jenkins, CI/CD pipelines, and core system Chef cookbooks.

**Areas of focus:**
* Maintained Graphite, Prometheus, Sensu, and Grafana at Scale
* Designed and implemented the Kubernetes monitoring strategy used across Sendgrid
* Experienced with Kubernetes, Helm, and ArgoCD
* Developed Kubernetes controllers in Go
* Built and maintained multiple core Chef cookbooks
* Rebuilt VM monitoring infrastructure in situ using Chef 
* Rebuilt and maintained Jenkins clusters and Chef CI/CD pipelines
