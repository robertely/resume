_Senior Operations Engineer with more than 10 years of experience in DevOps environments. Specializing in observability, Kubernetes, large scale time series databases, and physical infrastructures._


In my career I've focused on building with quality. Systems I build are reilabile, maintainable and have an emphasis on user expiereince.
I want to continue focusing on deep technical work but I won't shy away from leadership and architecture responsibilities. I'm seeking a mid sized company running Kubernetes and next generation monitoring tools at scale.
