As an engineer with experience in the DevOps roles, I'm passionate about automation using tools like Chef for configuration management, and I have developed custom tools to aid in development workflows. I specialize in developing for and working in complex environments where details and managing scope are important.


In the past I have spent the bulk of my time on automation and monitoring. I've migrated entire infrastructures onto Chef from scratch, as well as developed and actively maintained several non-trivial code bases, from microservices in automation to complex monitoring frontends. I've also always had a hard focus on extensive technical documentation with an emphasis on step-by-step procedures and run books.



In my spare time, I try to focus on hands-on technical projects; electronics and embedded design let me bring my development and technical skills home but still get my hands dirty. I'm particularly interested in ARM Embedded Linux systems and human device interaction. I keep extensive notes on everything I build or research at home, and while not all of it ends up online, I do maintain a blog at blog.reasonablycorrect.com. I try to keep every thing I write as beginner-friendly as possible so that a wide range of people can benefit from my research.


Some of the toughest challenges we face in our industry are managing complexity and scope creep. I always try to keep in mind what my goals are, and I am always mindful of technical debt generation. I've built several monitoring infrastructures in different organizations, the technical challenges are at times not the most difficult, however building a culture where testing and monitoring is built in early is far more difficult and I've worked with many teams to develop successful methodologies. Almost every thing I do has some element of automation: by utilizing build systems like Jenkins or configuration management systems -- or even Bash scripts -- I rarely need to repeat work. I keep this in mind in every thing I do. 


In future roles, I'm looking to be challenged by diving more deeply into my specialties. I hope to work on a team where I can apply what I already know but also continue learning from my peers. Specifically, I want to deep dive into monitoring tools, deployment systems, and the user facing workflows therein. Human/tooling interaction is a field that is often ignored in startups, but this is something I find deeply important and would like to spend more time working on.
