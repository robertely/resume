_Senior Operations Engineer with more than 10 years of experience in DevOps environmentsâ€”specializing in observability, Kubernetes, large scale time series databases, and physical infrastructures._

In my career I've focused on building with quality. The systems I build are reliable, are maintainable, and have an emphasis on user experience.
I want to continue focusing on deep technical work, but I won't shy away from leadership and architecture responsibilities. I'm seeking a mid-size company running Kubernetes and next generation monitoring tools at scale.
