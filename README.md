_Senior Operations Engineer with more than 10 years of experience in DevOps environments. Specializing in observability, Kubernetes, large scale time series databases, and physical infrastructures._


In my career I've focused on building with quality. Systems I build are reilabile, maintainable and have an emphasis on user expiereince.
I want to continue focusing on deep technical work but I won't shy away from leadership and architecture responsibilities. I'm seeking a mid sized company running Kubernetes and next generation monitoring tools at scale.## Twilio/SendGrid

### Staff Observability Engineer
##### Jul 2016 — Current
On the Observability team I've driven initiatives to increase the reliability and performance of our monitoring systems. I've planned and deploying a complete refactor of our VM monitoring stack. I designed and implemented our Kubernetes monitoring stack from scratch and dramatically lowered our operational toil through well tested automation.

**Areas of focus:**
* Maintained Graphite, Prometheus, Sensu, and Grafana at Scale
* Designed and implimented Kubernetes monitoring strategy used across Sendgrid
* Expierence with Kubernetes, Helm, ArgoCD
* Developed Kubernetes controllers in Go
* Built and maintained multiple core Chef cookbooks
